Web Development Coursework for   the end of   term: final   website assignment
This   assignment   consists   of two parts –   a website   and   a report   on the website   design   and production.   These   are marked   as   one   assignment
Brief 
Website 
Where will you be in   10 years? Your brief is to design and build a responsive   website that represents   the professional portfolio   of a version   of   you in   2034. This   can   be   as   realistic   or   as   fantastical   as you like, provided you   are   explicit   about the   effects   of   your   decision   on the   design   and   execution   of   your   assignment. 
Your web site should have   5 pages with   different   types   of material   and media,   including   video   and   sound   clips if relevant.
In   addition to the web site, you will include   a   report   as   a   file   called report.html with   associated images   etc. in your site's base   directory. This will   explain   what   you   have   learned   in   the   process   of building your site, where you found your information,   and how   you   have   adapted   any   resources   (if   applicable). The   structure   of the report is   described in the next   section. 
You   should avoid making use   of primarily   server   side   or pre-compiled frameworks such   as React or   WebPack. If   you use   CSS templates, for   example with Bootstrap,   make   sure   you   customise   it   enough to get   credit for your   own work – and make clear   which parts of   the code are   yours and which parts   come from the template library. You may   find it   safer   to   avoid   any   CSS   templates   or libraries,   but   they      are not prohibited provided they   are   clearly referenced   and that   you   have written   your   own   code   as well.
Report 
Your report.html   should   contain the following   (in this   order):
.            Your name
.          Introduction: What is the   essential story being told by   your portfolio   site?   Describe   the version   of   you that it is   about. What is the   audience you   are   addressing?   What   type   of structure   did   you choose to implement?
.          Inspiration: State 3 professional portfolio sites   (not   advices   articles   or portfolio templates) that
have inspired you when   creating your website. What   did you learn from   them?
.            Accessibility: State 3   ways in which your site is accessible.
.            Usability: State 3 ways in which you   considered the usability   of   your site.
.          Learning: State 3 things you had to learn   or find   out to   create your   site.   How   did   you   achieve   that?
.          Evaluation I: What   aspects   of   your work   do you think were particularly successful? Why?
.          Evaluation II: What   aspects   of   your work   could be improved? How might you   do things   differently   another time?
.          Resources: What resources   did you use in your work? List   any   sources   of information, libraries,   plugins,   code   or tools   (you   should   also indicate inclusions from   other   sources within your   code using   comments)
.            Appendices: Site map   (if useful), wireframes   and mock-ups

Materials from the web 
You   can use   almost   anything you like that you   can find   on the   Web,   but you   should   avoid   anything   that is not   open   or   out   of copyright   (e.g. that   costs money   or requires   login   or   registration).
On your report page   (and, wherever possible, in your   code) you   must   describe   what   you   have   taken,   where you took it from,   and what you   have   done   to   it.
If   you   copy-and-paste   something   almost without   change, you must   say   so   clearly   and give   credit to the   source. You will get   credit for making imported   code fit   in   with   and   enhance   your   own   design,   for understanding   and using   complex libraries,   or for   altering   and   enhancing material that you have   used.   代 写Web Development Coursework for the end of term: final website assignmentJava
